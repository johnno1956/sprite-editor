# sprite-editor
Hopefully a simple sprite editor

This is still a very much "cobbled together" attempt at creating a simple sprite editor.

Not a big deal for most, but for me, a huge deal.

This project has seen several languages being used. This one will use RCBasic.
Warning: I am not a programmer... No formal training. I tinker with code. Sometimes I get it right.

Feel free to use this code as you see fit... If it ends up working... lol... a simple accreditation would be appreciated.
